# odin-recipes

This is my first html project.
I made 3 recipes for Bulgogi, Goulash and Pasta.
See the following process to make the website that I worked on.

1. Put "boilerplate code" and "headings" for each recipe. 
2. Add "paragraphs" for description.
3. Add "unordered lists" for ingredients which don't need to be ordered.
4. Add "ordered lists" for cooking steps which ask for orders.
